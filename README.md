#Merit Portal

##Introduction

This is a Ruby On Rails application that is intended to used as a portal for connecting mentors and mentees. The portal will allow both parties to sign in and be presented with different options depending on whether the user has been authenticated as a mentor or a mentee. The portal will also track and display metrics entered by the mentees on a weekly basis.
